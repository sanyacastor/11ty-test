cardDescription: Sisal string structures built in the forest which try to evoke
  shafts of light coming through the trees.
previewDescription: The initial idea for this came from an old photo I saw of
  Grand Central Station in New York. The photo is black and white and shows the
  huge atrium in the interior of the station. Shafts of light stream through
  large windows on the side of the building illuminating the dwarfed figures
  standing there. The light seems so tactile, almost as if it actually was a
  three dimensional form.  Walking in the forest I had a similar experience of
  shafts of light pouring through gaps in the foliage in the afternoon sun. I
  tried to recreate this phenomenon, to give the illusion of light, but using
  sisal string.  These structures were build having developed a few prototypes
  first. They are made from one piece of string, which goes from the base to the
  top, and back again. They are temporary and at some stage will decay and fade
  away.
