  Kuznicza Street in Wroclaw
title: 6 hours for 6 days

cardDescription: My idea for this project was to explore the state of being
  stationary within a city that is in constant flux.
previewDescription: "The initial idea for this came from an old photo I saw of
  Grand Central Station in New York. The photo is black and white and shows the
  huge atrium in the interior of the station. Shafts of light stream through
  large windows on the side of the building illuminating the dwarfed figures
  standing there. The light seems so tactile, almost as if it actually was a
  three dimensional form. Walking in the forest I had a similar experience of
  these shafts of light pouring through gaps in the foliage in the afternoon
  sun. I tried to recreate this phenomenon, to give the illusion of light, but
  using sisal string. These structures were build having developed a few
  prototypes first. They are made from one piece of string, which goes from the
  base to the top, and back again. They are temporary and at some stage will
  decay and fade away. "

My idea for this project was to explore the state of being stationary within a
city that is in constant flux. From 06.09.06 until 11.09.06 for 6 hours a day I
sat on a bench in Kuznicza Street in Wroclaw. I wanted to see whether, for that
small section of the city, there were patterns/routines that I could identify,
and try to learn them, as one would learn a song.

However I soon realized that by merely being in the space for extended periods
of time I began to attract people’s curiosity. Although I had set out to watch
and learn the space I began to feel that it was in fact me that was being
observed. As the days passed I felt this mutual curiosity mount. But was it
actually mutual?

To explore this further, when I had finished the action, I asked Zosia Jarosz
and Marius Jodko to interview people in that particular space about ‘the guy on
the bench’. The video presents this material; a spectrum of memories,
encompassing the wildly inaccurate, the highly perceptive and those that simply
do not look.
