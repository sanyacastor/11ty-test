previewDescription: The Bike Gang (2015-18) is a series of fourteen 2-3 minute
  clips, to be experienced on smartphones, which employ anecdote and
  re-enactment to narrate four stories of bikes and belonging in Nairobi’s
  Eastlands.   In Nairobi, every weekday afternoon, starting from about 4pm,
  thousands of young Kenyan men congregate and relax at bazes, multi-ethnic,
  spaces of affiliation. The baze is a Kenyan public space par excellence, it is
  where people debate the news, swop stories and tell anecdotes. The baze, a
  space of performance and discussion, evidences a constellation of contemporary
  Kenyan identities.    The baze is deeply connected to digital media. Accounts
  of events are illustrated with images displayed on people’s phones, which are
  then passed around the baze to be inspected and critiqued by the gathering.
  This digital media is often a) self-produced b) saved locally c) shared
  peer-to-peer via bluetooth. The combination of this unique public space and
  smartphone images results in a special and extensive media ecology. Offline
  data becomes a generator and a vector for multiple narratives of Kenyan
  identity.    The Bike Gang is a project that inquires into this emergent
  bicycle scene and its affiliated media practice. John Kamicha and I worked
  with a group of cyclists from the Offroad Base over a period of 3 years,
  extending an existing “filmmaking” practice to try and catalyse and distribute
  stories of belonging.

The Bike Gang is an inquiry into the emergent bike subculture in Nairobi, Kenya. Working with a group of maverick cyclists and artists, the project represents this scene using strategies of collective and collaborative filmmaking and explores the idea of the anecdote as a vector of knowledge.

Over the last few years Nairobi has experienced a financial boom. An unexpected expression and perhaps consequence of this growth is an emerging bicycle subculture. A group of cyclists, many of whom are also artists, are eschewing conventional aspirations to own a house and car, and instead are building a bike scene, with a distinct set of cultures, practices and languages.

This emergent subculture evidences a strong and coherent counter-narrative to the current political doctrine in Kenya, namely that your identity is produced exclusively by your ethnicity. Not only does this fail to acknowledge the ways in which identities can be mutable and context-dependent but it constructs a landscape of identity which can easily be instrumentalised to violent political ends. The bike subculture can be seen as a powerful exemplar that contests this idea and with the agency of ordinary people defining themselves.

This phenomena resonates beyond Kenya. Adopting a subculture as an identity in contestation with traditional identities is, in some ways, a fundamentally global, contemporary action, made possible by internet access, networked communities and transnational interest groups. Nevertheless, this act of rebellion can also be read as an act of conformism within another monolithic structure, namely global capitalism. Contemporary subcultures are exploited, commodified and distributed via multinational brands and corporations. Yet, to some extent this group of bikers in Nairobi challenge notions of a universal, global 'brand' experience, through an embedded, local practice, a small but important contestation of the commercial realm.

Whilst this small group seems to stand for larger tectonic shifts, this project is, in essence, an intimate portrait of a series of individuals. For these young men, cycling is not about keeping healthy, or about getting from A to B, it is a project about belonging, both extreme and mundane. For example the weekend bike tours, are partly about getting some exercise, but are also about drinking lots, eating more and taking an assortment of recreational drugs. This extreme tendency is distilled in the practice of hanging; cycling in the slipstream of lorries on the highway, a contested subject of pride and discussion. 

Finally it is perhaps not unimportant to state that the project has a strong personal resonance. Coming from Kenya and being white I exist in an awkward in-between state, part insider, part outsider. The shared interest in bikes, and the shared identity of being a biker has created situations where our previous black and white given identities become complicated. Filming ourselves biking and watching those films together has generated conversations about power, race and privilege which would otherwise have been impossible. At the heart of this project there is a hope to try and grasp these fleeting incidences of utopia.
