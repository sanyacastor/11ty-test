collaborators: Central Prison of Leuven
thumbnailDescription: I numbered the bricks of an exterior prison wall in Leuven
  for seven hours a day, over a period of 10 days. I counted 15,776 bricks.
summary: "This performance entailed me numbering the bricks of an exterior
  prison wall in Leuven for seven hours a day, over a period of 10 days. The
  bricks were numbered in chalk. I counted 15,776 bricks.  The theoretical basis
  for the piece was the ambivalent nature of categorisation, which can be both
  useful, absurd, or in some cases, utterly abhorrent. However, whilst the
  action of numbering in bricks in chalk could be seen as ridiculous, within the
  context of an exhibition dealing with Buchenwald and the atrocities of the
  Nazi regime it assumed a more sombre and reflective quality.   The performance
  attempted, in both an absurd and perhaps ultimately futile manner, some form
  of representing the victims of WWII and the Holocaust. By performing the
  action day after day, and leaving a slowly developing, yet highly ephemeral
  trace on the wall, I hoped to give some indication, through both time and
  space, of the unimaginable scale of the atrocities. "
